# Riza Library

Riza is a library that provides functionality to build custom elements, supports connecting directly to [Wind](https://github.com/rsthn/rose-core/blob/master/Wind.md) compliant APIs and several pre-made elements to develop web applications fast.

## Installation

You can use npm/yarn to install the library, or use the standalone file (ESM) from the `dist` folder and include it in your index.html file.

<small>**NOTE:** All definitions exported by [Rinn](https://github.com/rsthn/rinn/) will be available as direct exports right from the `riza` object.</small>

```sh
yarn add riza
```

## Documentation

View the [docs](./docs/README.md) folder to view documentation of the exported classes and elements.
