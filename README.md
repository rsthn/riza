# Riza JS Framework

Riza is a library that provides functionality to build custom elements, support connecting directly to [Wind](https://github.com/rsthn/rose-core/blob/master/Wind.md)-compliant web services and several pre-made elements to develop web applications fast.

## Installation

You can use npm to install the library, or download the standalone `riza.js` file from the `dist` folder and include it in your index.html file, in the latter case an object named `riza` will be available in the global scope.

<small>**NOTE:** When using the web distribution, all definitions exported by [Rin](https://github.com/rsthn/rin/) will be available as exports from the `riza` object.</small>

```sh
npm i riza
```
