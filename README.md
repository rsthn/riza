# Riza Library

Riza is a library that provides functionality to build custom elements, supports connecting directly to [Wind](https://github.com/rsthn/rose-core/blob/master/Wind.md) compliant APIs and several pre-made elements to develop web applications fast.

Riza now has another branch with JSX suport and a lot of new features but unfortunately several incompatibilities with classic riza (this one). You can switch if you like, by updating to riza version 2. This branch (classic) will continue to be maintained.

## Installation

You can use your favorite package manager to install the library, or use the standalone files from the `dist` folder and include the respective flavor (ESM or global) in your `index.html` file.

<small>**NOTE:** All definitions exported by [Rinn](https://github.com/rsthn/rinn/) will be available as direct exports right from the `riza` package.</small>

```sh
pnpm add riza
```

## Documentation

View the [docs](./docs/README.md) folder to view documentation of the exported classes and elements.
