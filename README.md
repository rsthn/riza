# Riza JS Framework

Riza is a library that provides functionality to build custom elements, support connecting directly to [Wind](https://github.com/rsthn/rose-core/blob/master/Wind.md)-compliant web services and several pre-made elements to develop web applications fast.

## Installation

You can use npm/yarn to install the library, or download the standalone file from the `dist` folder (either CJS or ESM) and include it in your index.html file.

<small>**NOTE:** When using the web distribution, all definitions exported by [Rin](https://github.com/rsthn/rin/) will be available as exports right from the `riza` object.</small>

```sh
npm install riza
```

## Documentation

View the [docs](./docs/README.md) folder to view documentation of the exported classes and elements.
