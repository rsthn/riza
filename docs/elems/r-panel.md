# r-panel

Content panel with router support. Useful to easily show/hide content based on the current route. Flexible CSS classes control the state to allow animations when desired. To manually set some `r-panel` as visible by default simply set its CSS class to `active`.

|Attribute|Required|Description
|---------|--------|-----------
|`data-route`|Optional|Route required to activate the panel. When the route is activated the panel will be shown and when route is deactivated the panel will be hidden. If no route is provided, the panel will be visible at all times.
